**We will NEVER use Patient Data for our own purposes, such as marketing, advertising, data mining, or selling it to third parties.**

## 4. How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information or your Patient Data. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers who need access to the data to perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), payment processing, and email delivery. These providers are contractually obligated to protect the data and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose information if we believe it's required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cliniq, our users, or the public.
*   **Business Transfers:** If Cliniq is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control.
*   **With Your Consent:** We may share information with your consent or at your direction.

## 5. Data Security

We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect the information we process. This includes measures like:
*   Encryption of data in transit (using SSL/TLS) and at rest.
*   Strict access controls to limit access to information to authorized personnel.
*   Regular security assessments.

However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our systems. You are also responsible for securing your account credentials.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your User account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service.

We retain the Patient Data you provide for as long as your account is active. Upon termination of your account, we will provide you with an opportunity to export your Patient Data. After a designated period (e.g., 30-60 days), we will permanently delete your account and all associated Patient Data from our live systems in accordance with our data deletion policies.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to access, update, or correct your own account information at any time through your account settings. You can also request the deletion of your account by contacting us.

### B. For Patients

If you are a patient of one of our Users, you must direct any requests to access, correct, or delete your personal information to your medical practitioner (the Data Controller). As a Data Processor, we cannot fulfill these requests directly.

## 8. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, or country where the data protection laws may differ. If you are located outside of the Philippines, please note that we transfer the data to the Philippines and process it there. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a User, you are responsible for obtaining parental consent before entering the information of a minor into the Service.
