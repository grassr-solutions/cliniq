**Last Updated:** July 31, 2025

Welcome to Cliniq! These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") govern your use of the Cliniq web application, software, and services (collectively, the "**Service**") provided by Grassr Solutions ("**Cliniq**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**").

By creating an account or using the Service, you, a licensed medical practitioner ("**User**," "**you**," "**your**"), agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and, if applicable, a Service Agreement or Business Associate Agreement (BAA). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Description of Service

Cliniq provides a cloud-based platform for solo medical practitioners to manage patient information, records, and appointment schedules. The Service is intended to be a tool to assist in the administrative management of your practice.

*   **Account Information:** You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.
*   **Account Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. Cliniq is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account credentials.

## 3. User Responsibilities and Conduct

*   **Compliance with Laws:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, laws related to patient privacy, data protection, and medical record-keeping (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
*   **Patient Data:** You are solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all patient data, including Protected Health Information (PHI) or Sensitive Personal Information, that you upload, input, or manage through the Service ("**Patient Data**").

## 4. Responsibility for Exported and Printed Data

The Service may allow you to print or export copies of Patient Data, including medical files and prescriptions. You acknowledge and agree to the following:

*   **Transition to Physical Copy:** Creating a printed or exported copy of Patient Data removes it from the secure digital environment of the Cliniq Service.

*   **Sole Responsibility:** You, as the Data Controller, assume sole and complete responsibility for the security, safeguarding, storage, transport, and eventual proper destruction of any and all physical or exported copies of Patient Data.
*   **Compliance:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that your handling of these physical records complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the physical security requirements of the Data Privacy Act (DPA) and HIPAA. Cliniq has no liability for any breach, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of Patient Data that occurs after it has been printed or exported from the Service by you.
