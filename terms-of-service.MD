**Last Updated:** August 9, 2025

Welcome to Cliniq! These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") are a binding legal agreement between you, a licensed medical practitioner ("**User**," "**you**," "**your**"), and Grassr Solutions ("**Cliniq**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**"), governing your use of the Cliniq web application, software, and all related services (collectively, the "**Service**").

By creating an account, or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our **[Privacy Policy](https://github.com/grassr-solutions/cliniq/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.MD)**. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility and Account Security

*   **Account Security:** You are fully responsible for safeguarding your account credentials (username and password) and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of your account. Cliniq is not liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge.

## 2. User Responsibilities and Professional Conduct

*   **Compliance with Laws:** You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and professional ethical guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA), rules of the Department of Health, and your professional code of conduct.
*   **Patient Data and Consent:** You are the **Personal Information Controller (PIC)** for all patient data you input into the Service ("**Patient Data**"). You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary patient consents and have a legal basis for collecting, processing, and storing their information within the Service. You are solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of all Patient Data.
*   **Professional Judgment:** The Service is an administrative and decision-support tool. It is **NOT** a substitute for your independent professional medical judgment, skill, or experience. You are solely responsible for all diagnoses, treatments, prescriptions, and all other aspects of your clinical practice and patient care.

## 3. Third-Party Integrations

The Service may allow you to connect with third-party applications, such as Google Calendar ("**Third-Party Services**"). Your use of any Third-Party Service is subject to the following:
*   **Your Discretion and Risk:** Your use of a Third-Party Service is at your own discretion and risk.
*   **Google Calendar Synchronization:** If you choose to connect your Google Calendar, you grant Cliniq permission to access your calendar data as described in our Privacy Policy. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Google Calendar integration complies with all applicable regulations, including HIPAA. For HIPAA compliance, you must have a Google Workspace account that is covered by a valid Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Google.
*   **Third-Party Terms:** You agree to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of any Third-Party Service you use. Cliniq is not a party to your agreement with the provider of the Third-Party Service.

## 4. Specific Terms for the AI Assistant

The Service includes an AI Assistant feature designed to analyze consultation notes and suggest potential differential diagnoses. You acknowledge and agree to the following:
*   **Informational Tool Only:** The AI Assistant is a supplementary, informational tool only. It is not a diagnostic device and has not been approved as such by the FDA or any medical authority.
*   **No Substitute for Professional Judgment:** The output of the AI Assistant is not medical advice and must not be used as a substitute for your own clinical evaluation and judgment.
*   **Risk of Inaccuracy:** The AI-generated suggestions may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate for a specific patient. You must independently verify all information.
*   **Sole Responsibility:** You are solely and exclusively responsible and liable for all clinical decisions, actions, and outcomes, regardless of whether you used the AI Assistant. You agree to hold Cliniq harmless from any claims arising from your reliance on the AI Assistant's output.

## 5. Responsibility for Exported and Printed Data

The Service allows you to print or export Patient Data. You acknowledge and agree that:
