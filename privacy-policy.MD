# Cliniq - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** August 1, 2025

Welcome to Cliniq. Grassr Solutions ("**Cliniq**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you, a licensed medical practitioner ("**User**," "**you**," "**your**"), use our web application and services (collectively, the "**Service**").

This policy is designed to help you comply with your obligations under the Republic Act No. 10173, also known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA), and its implementing rules and regulations.

By creating an account and using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the collection, processing, and use of information in accordance with this policy. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with our **[Terms of Service](https://github.com/grassr-solutions/cliniq/blob/main/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.MD)**.

## 1. The Roles of the Parties under the Data Privacy Act (DPA)

To understand our respective data protection obligations, it is crucial to define our roles:

*   **You (The User/Practitioner):** For all data related to your patients that you input, upload, or manage within the Service ("**Patient Data**"), you are the **"Personal Information Controller" (PIC)** as defined by the DPA. This means you determine the purposes for which and the manner in which Patient Data is processed. You are solely responsible for ensuring the legality of processing and for obtaining all necessary patient consents.
*   **Cliniq (The Service Provider):** For this same Patient Data, Cliniq acts as the **"Personal Information Processor" (PIP)**. We process this data strictly on your behalf and according to your instructions for the sole purpose of providing, maintaining, and securing the Service as detailed in these terms. For users subject to HIPAA, we act as a **"Business Associate."**
*   **Your Account Information:** For your own account and billing information that you provide to us, Cliniq is the **PIC**.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide to Us (Your Data)
*   **Account Information:** When you register, we collect your full name, email address, phone number, clinic/practice details, PRC license number, and a secure password.
*   **Billing Information:** To process subscription payments, our third-party payment processors (e.g., PayMongo, Stripe, PayPal) collect billing details, such as credit/debit card information and billing addresses. We do not store your full credit card information on our servers.

### B. Information We Process on Your Behalf (Patient Data)
As a core function of the Service, you will provide Patient Data, which may include Sensitive Personal Information under the DPA. This may include, but is not limited to:
*   Demographic information (Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Contact Details)
*   Medical History, Consultation Notes, Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Lab Results
*   Appointment Schedules
*   Patient Photographs

**You represent and warrant that you have a legal basis and have obtained all necessary consents from your patients to collect, process, and disclose their Patient Data using our Service.**

### C. Information from Your Use of the Service
*   **Usage Data:** We automatically collect metadata and analytics on how you interact with the Service, such as features used, clicks, session duration, and other actions. This helps us improve the Service.
*   **Device and Log Information:** We collect technical information from your device, including IP address, browser type, operating system, and error logs.
*   **Cookies:** We use cookies and similar technologies to operate the Service, authenticate your session, and remember your preferences.

## 3. How We Use Information

### A. How We Use Your User Information (as a PIC)
*   To provide, operate, secure, and maintain the Service.
*   To process your subscription payments and manage your account.
*   To send you technical notices, security alerts, and administrative messages.
*   To respond to your support requests and inquiries.
*   To monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve our Service.

### B. How We Use Patient Data (as a PIP)
Our use of Patient Data is strictly limited by our role as your Personal Information Processor. We will only process Patient Data to:
*   Provide, maintain, and secure the Service **as directed by you**.
*   Troubleshoot technical issues or provide support **at your explicit request**.
*   Process it through the AI Assistant feature to generate potential differential diagnoses, solely for your review within your account.

**We will NEVER use, sell, rent, or share Patient Data for our own commercial purposes, such as advertising, data mining, or research, without your explicit, separate consent. Patient Data is NOT used to train our AI models for the benefit of other users.**

## 4. How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information or Patient Data. We may share information only in these limited circumstances:
*   **With Service Providers:** We engage third-party vendors to perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting (Google Cloud Platform) and payment processing. These providers are contractually bound to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
*   **For Legal Compliance:** We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cliniq, our users, or the public.
*   **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service of any change in ownership.
*   **With Your Consent:** We may share information for other purposes with your explicit consent.

## 5. Data Security

We implement robust administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards designed to protect the information we process, in compliance with the DPA. These measures include:
*   Encryption of data in transit (TLS) and at rest.
*   Strict access controls and principles of least privilege.
*   Use of a secure cloud infrastructure provider (Google Cloud) covered by a Business Associate Amendment.
*   Regular security reviews and updates.

However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. **You are also responsible for maintaining the security of your account by using a strong password and protecting it from unauthorized use.**

**Scope of Security:** Our security safeguards apply only to data stored digitally within the Cliniq platform. **Once data is exported, downloaded, or printed by you, it is no longer under our protection.** You, as the PIC, are solely responsible for implementing your own security measures to protect physical or locally-stored copies of Patient Data.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your User account information as long as your account is active or as needed to comply with our legal obligations.

We retain Patient Data on your behalf as long as your account is active. Upon termination of your account, you will be given a reasonable period (e.g., 30-60 days) to export your Patient Data. After this period, we will permanently and securely delete your account and all associated Patient Data from our production systems in accordance with our data destruction policies.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

### A. For Users (Practitioners)
You have the right to access, update, or correct your own account information at any time. You can also request the deletion of your account by contacting us.

### B. Regarding Your Patients' Rights
As the PIC, you are responsible for honoring the rights of your patients (Data Subjects) under the DPA, which include the rights to be informed, to access, to object, to erasure or blocking, to rectification, and to data portability. Cliniq, as your PIP, will provide you with the necessary tools within the Service to help you respond to your patients' requests (e.g., exporting or deleting a patient's record). If we receive a request directly from one of your patients, we will direct them to contact you.

## 8. HIPAA and International Use

Our Service is designed with security principles that align with HIPAA's technical safeguards. If you are a "Covered Entity" under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), you are responsible for determining if you require a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Grassr Solutions. Please contact us to initiate this process. For all other users, especially those in the Philippines, the DPA is the primary governing regulation.

Your information is processed and stored on secure cloud servers which may be located outside of the Philippines. We rely on the robust data protection agreements and security certifications of our cloud provider (Google Cloud) to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through a notice within the Service prior to the change becoming effective.
